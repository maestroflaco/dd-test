Students build self-esteem and social awareness through an in-depth exploration of Latin social dances such as Salsa, Merengue, Cha-cha and Bachata. Native dances are used as a jump-off for students to discover and celebrate the rich cultural heritages of Latin American countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Ballroom social graces, teamwork, and collaboration are reinforced each step of the way as students master and perform their dances. Maestro Flaco is a master teaching artist whose teaching style and unmatched enthusiasm for his work makes his students want to succeed, and helps them to believe they can!"
