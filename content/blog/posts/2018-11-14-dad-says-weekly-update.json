Next week, previous beginners who are interested in taking Bop 2 in the Spring are invited to join in for a refresher beginning next Sunday at 7 p.m. Space is very limited, so please only attend if you wish to enroll in Bop 2, and are ready to do so at the first refresher. Information on the details of the session will be shared immediately with enrollees, and will be coming soon to the web site.\n\n\n\nFinally, come and join us on Saturday, April 8 at 9 p.m. as we bring the Latin flavor to PB's Diner &amp; Tap House! (corner of Delsea Dr, & Greentree Rd. in Glassboro, NJ). Join me, and help to welcome <strong>PAPO GELY y Su Orquesta</strong> to the stage! There is NO COVER for this live music and dancing event, but there will be FOOD & DRINK SPECIALS all night long! We'll have a Salsa dance performance, along with a chance for you to dance, as well... of course!\n\n\n\nAll this , and only 3 exits up on Rt. 55? It's close, convenient, plenty of parking and it's FREE!!     !ONE NIGHT ONLY!!   Be there...\n\n\n\nÂ¡Hasta La Pista!"
